# Cookies, pixels, and similar technology

We use cookies, tracking pixels (or "Pixels"), device and other IDs, and local storage (collectively known as "Technology") to display, protect, and organize the products and services contained in this website ---www.us.bureauveritas.com---.

We offer a range of features that use this Technology to engage with you based on your activity within and outside of our services. To learn more about the ways you can control this, visit the "Privacy Options" section below.

We suggest that you regularly check this page in order to have the most up-to-date information about this Technology and how it is used.

Your browser or device may provide you with configuration settings related to this Technology. To learn more about the availability of these settings, their role and their operation, check the Help section of your browser or device, and visit the "Privacy Options" section below. Some settings may interfere with your use of the features that we offer. Furthermore, settings adjusted in a browser or a device typically apply only to that browser or device.

||| Note that if you delete a cookie, or if you do not agree to the use of cookies on your machine, you may not be able to take advantage of some of the services on this website.

# About this Technology

Cookies are small files placed on your browser or your device by a website or application you are using. Pixels (also known as clear GIFs, web beacons, or pixel tags) are small blocks of code on a web page or application that allow websites perform operations including reading and placing cookies, and sending information to Bureau Veritas or our partners. This connection can then provide information such as the device's IP address, the date of the pixel's display, the ID number associated with the browser or device, and the type of browser used. Local storage is standard technology that authorises a website or application to store data on a computer, mobile phone, or another user device and extract it from there. For example, this can include local storage, HTML5 caching, or device storage.

# Why do we use this Technology?

We use this Technology for a variety of reasons, in particular to ensure that we can offer you the most appropriate content and improve our products and services.

	Statistics and measurements
	Tools such as cookies and similar technology  (like information on your device or a pixel on a website) are used to obtain  statistics about people who see and interact with our site.

	Site services and features
	These tools provide features that help us  offer services.
	For example, we can use a cookie that lets us suggest that users in the United States view the Bureau Veritas US site.

	Performance
	They help us make your use of the site as pleasant as possible.
	For example, we can use cookies and similar technology to ensure that your site's features load and respond more quickly.

# When might we use this Technology?

We can place or use this Technology when you visit our website using a browser or a device that allows for placing or using the appropriate Technology. For example, when you visit our website, we can place or read cookies, or receive information coming from your device.

# In what circumstances do we read cookies from your computer ordevice?

Web browsers send cookies for a specific web domain (e.g. bureauveritas.com) to the website each time a device having those cookies accesses content coming from that domain. This means that a bureauveritas.com cookie will be sent to Bureau Veritas each time a user opens a page on bureauveritas.com from that computer or device. This also means that these cookies are sent to Bureau Veritas each time a user accesses a third-party website or application that integrates or uses our services, notably one of our modules.

Sometimes, we work with web sites, applications, and their partners to place or read Bureau Veritas cookies on your browsers or devices. This allows us to collect statistical information, allowing us to improve the content and services that we offer you.

# Third-party cookies

Our site contains sharing buttons that allow you to share some of our content on social networks. These third-party sites may record your browsing information. We encourage you to check their terms of use for more information on their use of cookies.

# Privacy options 

To control how cookies are used, you can configure the settings of most browsers to automatically accept or reject all cookies, or to be asked each time a site attempts to leave a cookie. Some parts of our services do not require the use of cookies. However, our Bureau Veritas site and some of its services may not operate properly if cookies are completely disabled.

В случае противоречия между английской версией данного документа и настоящим переводом, английская версия имеет преимущественную юридическую силу. Только версия настоящего документа, находящаяся по адресу https://thequestion.com/cookies, является юридически обязывающей.

Обновлено: 22/08/2018

Znanie Development Company Ltd и все его лицензиаты (далее – «Мы») используем куки на нашем веб-сайте (далее – «Сервис»). Используя Сервис, вы соглашаетесь с этим.

Согласившись на эту политику, вы соглашаетесь с тем, что мы можем отличить вас от других пользователей нашего веб-сайта. Это помогает нам предоставить вам хороший пользовательский интерфейс, индивидуальный контент, а также позволяет нам постоянно совершенствовать наш сайт. Например, мы можем распознавать и запоминать важную информацию, которая сделает наш веб-сайт более удобным для вашего просмотра.

В нашей политике куки указано, что такое файлы куки, как мы используем куки-файлы, как сторонние пользователи могут использовать куки-файлы в Сервисе, ваш выбор в отношении файлов куки и дополнительную информацию о файлах куки.

# Что такое куки-файлы

Куки-файлы – это небольшие фрагменты текста, отправленные вашим веб-браузером на веб-сайт, который вы посещаете. Файл куки хранится в вашем веб-браузере и позволяет Сервису или третьей стороне распознать вас и сделать ваш следующий визит проще, а Сервис более полезным для вас.

Мы используем файлы куки для следующих целей: для включения определенных функций Сервиса, для аналитики, для хранения ваших предпочтений, для обеспечения доставки рекламных материалов, включая поведенческую рекламу.

Типы файлов куки, используемых на этом веб-сайте, можно разделить на несколько категорий:

	Сессионные куки: для конкретного посещения, ограничены отправкой идентификаторов сеансов (случайные числа, сгенерированные сервером), поэтому вам не нужно повторно вводить информацию при переходе на новую страницу или выходить из нее. Файлы куки сеанса не сохраняются на вашем устройстве и не удаляются при закрытии браузера;
	
	Постоянные файлы куки: для записи информации о ваших предпочтениях и сохранения в кеше браузера или в мобильном устройстве;
	
	Основные файлы куки: мы можем использовать важные файлы куки для аутентификации пользователей и предотвращения мошеннического использования учетных записей пользователей; а также
	
	Сторонние куки-файлы: помещены кем-то другим, кроме нас, которые могут собирать данные на нескольких сайтах или сеансах.

# Что вы можете сделать с куки-файлами

Если вы хотите удалить файлы куки или проинструктировать веб-браузер об удалении или отказе от куки-файлов, перейдите на страницу справки вашего веб-браузера.

Обратите внимание, однако, что, если вы удаляете файлы куки или отказываетесь принять их, возможно, вы не сможете использовать все функции, которые мы предлагаем, вы не сможете сохранить свои предпочтения, и некоторые из наших страниц могут отображаться неправильно.

# Где вы можете найти больше информации о куки-файлах

Вы можете узнать больше о файлах куки через следующие сторонние веб-сайты:

	AllAboutCookies: http://www.allaboutcookies.org/
	
	Network Advertising Initiative: http://www.networkadvertising.org/

# Если вы – резидент Евросоюза:

Для получения дополнительной информации об управлении куки посетите сайт www.youronlinechoices.eu, на котором содержится дополнительная информация о поведенческой рекламе и конфиденциальности в Интернете.

# Изменения в нашей политике по использованию куки

Эта политика куки может время от времени обновляться.

Если мы изменим что-либо важное в этой политике куки, мы сообщим вам через всплывающее окно на веб-сайте в течение разумного промежутка времени до и после изменения. Вы можете просмотреть политику куки, посетив веб-сайт и нажав ссылку «Политика использования куки».
